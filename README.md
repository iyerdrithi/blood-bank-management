# blood-bank-management
Created a blood bank management system using php and phpmyadmin for the capstone class requirement
<br>
The system was targeted at rural areas who don't have continuous access to blood supply when needed due to not having a proper system in place. The blood bank managament system allowed facilities to register their clinics in the system. Once registered, the they can send blood requests by filling a form. This request is viewed by the admin who makes appropriate status changes to the supply.
<br>
In the future, we want to include more functionalities to the system by adding blood inventory management functions.
